  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <h3>The kinds of platforms that I've used</h3>
  <p>Born and raised in Columbia, Tennessee, I used Windows operating systems exclusively until 2015, when a friend gave me a 2012 MacBook Pro that he modified himself, replacing
     the hard disk with an SSD and upgrading the RAM to 16GB. It still works like a charm, although I've been hamstrung by the hardware such that MacOS Sierra
     is the latest iteration of the operating system that I can run. My first exposure to Linux came in the spring of 2019, in the form of a Unix-like environment 
     provided by Cloud9, an online integrated development environment (IDE).
