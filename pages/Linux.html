  <h2>About Linux</h2>
  <h3>What Linux means to me</h3>
  <p> The process of leaning Linux has taught me a lot about critical thinking. It is like a master class in how to adopt the mindset of an autodidact. It soon became 
      clear to me that, if I was ever going to grasp the fundamental concepts of operating system and computer networks, I had to figure out how to codify what was known
      to me at any given time, in addition to what I didn't know at that time. Then I remembered a pie chart of knowledge that I once saw on Instagram. I think this one
      provides a good visual. ---> <a href="www.pieofknowledge.com/about.html">The Pie of Knowledge</a> Another important aspect of this that I realized is that, since
      the boundaries of each portion of the pie are always moving, assumptions serve as self-imposed constants whenever it comes to making decisions in any dynamic environment 
      like this. This is the most recent basis of my managerial philosophy. These is an iterative process, and no mortal being is omniscient.
  </p>
  <p> I think two more things are important to note here. These are things that were mentioned as an aside in an agile software development class I took at MTSU.
      Documentation of any sort should be treated as a means to an end, not the end in itself. Remember time is limited on any project. Documentation is great, but it is
      sometimes at odds with productivity. But on the other hand, if someone does have the time to compile a value body of knowledge, like this website for instance, then
      that can possibly serve as a point of reference for newcomers or seasoned professionals that have forgotten a few things here and there.
