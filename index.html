                       <p> 
                            I built this personal website using GitHub Pages as the platform, and Jekyll, a static site generator (SSG) written in Ruby. 
                            I chose GitHub Pages on account of the free web hosting, the option of an SSL certificate (now referred to as a TLS certificate), and
                            the fact that I needed to learn how to use Git. A personal website was a long awaited ambition of mine, so I figured this was the ideal 
                            stepping stone to becoming proficient with Git as well as GitHub.

                       <p>
                            I'm pretty satisfied with the progress I've made on my site this year. Colleagues can now call me, text me, or email me from the contact
                            page. However, on the contact page, you have to literally click on the word Home in order to return to the homepage. I couldn't figure out
                            how to make the entire button clickable. The content found in both the Platforms and Resources dropdown menus in the homepage's side navigation
                            bar will remain a work in progress. In other news, you can now view/download the latest generic version of my resume by clicking on the Experience
                            tab while on the About Me page. I also have a number of non-functional URL links on my online resources page for the time being. More later.
